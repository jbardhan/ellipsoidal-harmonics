The spherical harmonic analysis suggested a simple ansatz that
possessed significantly better accuracy than either of the BIBEE
models, but could not be resolved as a simple modified boundary
condition as can the others.  As a result, the simple ansatz cannot
readily be implemented outside the sphere problem, which is
discouraging.  This result seemed at first to contradict the
separability condition, but closer inspection reveals that it odes
not, for the following reason.  The designed ansatz relates the
fixed-charge Coulomb potential to the reaction-field potential at the
surface; however, the BIBEE separation of variables occurs in the
determination of the approximate surface charge distribution.  The
estimation of electrostatic free energies using separable
approximations has been highlighted very recently as a way to
incorporate dielectric effects into classical density functional
theory (DFT)~\cite{Gillespie}; thus, the separability approach to
analyzing electrostatic models may have broader applications than the
one described here.


\section{Comparison to the GB$\epsilon$ Model}\label{sec:GBeps}


\subsection{The Electrostatic Radius As A Spherical Capacitance Problem}\label{sec:capacitance}
The GB$\epsilon$ model computes the ``electrostatic radius'' of a
molecule by employing the Born expression for the self-energy of one
point charge in the molecule as $\beta \to \infty$.  In introducing
the method, Sigalov \textit{et al.} discuss several aspects of the
physical significance of this parameter, including the fact that all
of the charges' self-energies approach the same value in this
limit~\cite{Sigalov05}.  Although the authors do note that this limit
corresponds to the solute becoming a conductor, apparently one
relationship that has not been discussed is that the electrostatic
radius may be interpreted as an \textit{equivalent spherical
  capacitor}.  Consequently, methods for calculating capacitance may
be valuable for GB$\epsilon$ understanding and implementation.

A linear capacitor is defined by the relation $Q = C V$, where $Q$ is
the net charge on the conductor surface, $C$ is the capacitance, and
$V$ is the potential of the conductor relative to ground; the energy
stored in such a configuration is $E = \frac{1}{2} Q^2/C$.  Because
the electric field must be zero inside a conductor, the potential
everywhere inside must be constant, including at the boundary
$\Omega$.  Furthermore, as Sigalov \textit{et al.}  discussed, the
total amount of surface charge is exactly equal in magnitude and
opposite in sign to the net charge $\int_{V_1} \rho(\vr) dV$.  We may
therefore use the following scheme to calculate the self-energy of a
+1$e$ point charge, where $e$ is the electron charge $1.6\times
10^{-19}$ Coulombs.  First, one assumes that the molecule has no
charges inside it, so that the Laplace equation holds in both $V_1$
and $V_2$. second, set the potential at $\Omega$ to be $1$ Volt and
compute the equivalent capacitance $C$ of the molecule.  Finally, one
calculates $\frac{1}{2} e^2/C$.  It is well-known that the capacitance
problem can be solved using the first-kind Fredholm boundary integral
equation
\begin{equation}
  \varphi(\vr) = \int_\Omega \sigma(\vrp) \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi ||\vr-\vrp||} d^2\vrp 
\end{equation}
where $\varphi(\vr)$ is the potential at the conductor surface and again
$\sigma(\vr)$ is the induced charge density.  

We have demonstrated this relationship using the residue glutamate
with neutral capping groups, built using the software
VMD~\cite{Humphrey96} and the CHARMM force field~\cite{MacKerell98}.
Plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:radius-as-capacitance} are the relative RMS
deviations of the point charges' self-energies compared to the energy
stored in the ``capacitor'' molecule when a total of $-1 e$ charge
is situated on its surface.

  these calculations, $\epsilon_2 = 80$ always and $\epsilon_1$ varies
  from 2 to $10^5$.}\protect\label{fig:radius-as-capacitance}

\section{Discussion}
% effective dielectric constants
\begin{enumerate}
\item Overscreening (dangerous word because it shows up elsewhere
  meaning other things, we propose the alternative X)
  \end{enumerate}

% Capacitance
\begin{enumerate}
\item The problem of rapidly estimating capacitances has received
  extensive treatment due to its practical importance in the design
  of integrated circuits~\cite{foo}.
\item Fast methods for solving these integral equations are among the
  first applications of fast BEM methods
\item Because the convergence of an iterative method such as GMRES is
  rapid for these problems, one may be able to efficiently maintain a
  highly accurate estimate of the molecule's e-s radius (show that
  it's important with an example), i.e. not fully solving the
  capacitance problem but estimating it by a few iterations ie low
  tolerance solve.
\item Tree codes and FMM may all be used, cite Onufriev other paper,
 since implementations suitable already exist, these should be
readily integrated with no heuristics necessary.
\item Point out Sigalov06 problems with capacitance estimation heuristics
  that they introduced, but do so nicely.
\item We have not run the finite-difference calculations reported by
  Sigalov05 but note that the challenges of high accuracy capacitance
  calculations motivated the development of boundary-integral methods
  for their computation (old papers, ask Jacob).  The large errors
  reported in the GBeps paper may result from the same errors--it
  becomes essentially an exterior problem.
\end{enumerate}

% dielectric constant dependence
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have found that the BIBEE methods do not exhibit nearly the
  accuracy that GB$\epsilon$ does while varying the dielectric
  constants.  
\item This result was anticipated given two facts.  First, the
  polarization free energy changes from being negative in sign
  (i.e. favorable transfer out of a uniform medium of dielectric
  constant $\epsilon_1$ and into one with $\epsilon_2$) to a positive
  quantity if $\epsilon_1 > \epsilon_2$.  Second, BIBEE/P and
  BIBEE/CFA make complementary assumptions about the important
  eigenmodes and one keeps the constant field, one keeps the highly
  varying fields.  The importance of these two components switches
  place as $\beta$ goes from zero to infinity (check).
\item Eigenvectors are still well preserved, which is in keeping with
  our earlier analysis (cite paper) for a sphere that the BIBEE
  eigenvectors are exact; that analysis did not rest on the particular
  dielectric constants.  However, the eigenvectors are also very good
  even when the estimated energies are highly inaccurate.
\item Noteworthy that the eigenvectors of BIBEE reaction-potential
  operator are invariant with respect to dielectric constant (check):
  are the eigenvectors of the actual problem?  more analysis is
  needed.
\item We are working to develop a dielectric-dependent BIBEE given our
  emphasis on general approximation schemes, and motivated by the
  success of the GB$\epsilon$ model.  However, for protein problems
  this should not be a big deal.
\end{enumerate}

% general
\begin{enumerate}
\item We are approximating the induced surface charge, whereas the
  basis for GB is the approximation of the reaction field potential
  directly.
\item The latter might be argued to be the easier approximation to
  make, since it is smoother (it is the Coulomb convolution integral
  over the induced charge, one degree smoother mathematically)
\item We have made some progress but clearly there is still a long way
  to go.  BIBEE is not currently as accurate as modern GB approaches.
\item The mathematical basis for the BIBEE approach is strong,
  however, and we are continuing to explore how the extensive
  analytical efforts on GB may be leveraged in a mathematically
  general approximate electrostatic model.
\item Our strategy also benefits from a century of mathematical
  analysis of the boundary integral operator that BIBEE
  approximates~\cite{Plemelj11,Ahner86,Ahner94,Ahner94_2,Martensen99}.
\item Specifically, it is known that the sum of its eigenvalues are an
  invariant for a sphere, spheroid, or ellipsoid, a property that may
  well explain the remarkable accuracy of the $\alpha$ parameter in
  the GB$\epsilon$ model for a wide range of realistic problems, when
  it has only been parameterized for the sphere.
\end{enumerate}

We also obtain an explanation for BIBEE's excellent preservation of
the reaction-potential matrix eigenvectors: for the spherical cavity,
the BIBEE approximation exactly preserves the eigenfunctions of the
actual reaction-potential operator.  Further analysis will be required
to determine whether this rigorous result holds also for nontrivial
geometries, but the present finding at least provides a theoretical
justification for the remarkable behavior of the BIBEE approximation,
and earlier results on peptides (i.e. nonspherical solutes) illustrate
its quality for problems that do not yet have as strong a theoretical
understanding~\cite{Bardhan08_BIBEE}.  Finally, our analysis
illustrates the BIBEE models can be interpreted as Poisson problems
with modified boundary conditions, and offers a simple mathematical
model to explain why the BIBEE/CFA and BIBEE/P variants exhibit
complementary accuracy for charge distributions that generate smoothly
or rapidly varying normal electric fields.


The BIBEE algorithm should be contrasted with the surface-charge
generalized Born (SCGB) model of Fedichev et
al.~\cite{Fedichev09,Fedichev09_2}.  In that approach, one finds
effective Born radii using either the CFA or other methods, and then
similar to BIBEE computes an approximate induced surface charge by
assuming that the surface charge density at a point ${\bf r}$ on the
surface is proportional to the normal electric field there.  However,
unlike BIBEE, the authors scale each point charge's contribution to
the surface charge density by the charge's Born radius.  A more
detailed analysis of this approach is outside the scope of this work;
however, as the authors note, their approach generates the exact
solution for a sphere.
